## Hello!

My name is John Maruska. Professionally I'm a software
engineer, most of my experience has been on backend data
ingestion systems and my favorite language Clojure. Personally,
I'm interested in heavy metal, cheesy monster movies, VTubers,
learning bass guitar, and playing co-operative games with
friends.

This website is in the first pass at what I'm hoping will be
a long-lived personal blogging endeavor. I enjoy reading and
learning about software development, and I'm hoping this
website can act as a means to push myself into doing that more
actively and get better retention out of my efforts.

I don't have any posts yet, so this area mostly serves as a
placeholder until that happens. Hopefully I'll have something
to show you soon.

Things that aren't done yet that I'd like to
- Styling Resume page for mobile
- Add a "download PDF" button to Resume page which gives the word-document-created PDF that I actually send out.
- Styling site-wide to use Solarized coloring and a new font
- Write a blogpost about my knowledge management system, synthesis of PARA and GTD and Zettelkasten.
- Write a blogpost about how I use git and what it gives me
- Write a blogpost with my dev resource library. Recommendations on books, favorite blogposts, topics to rabbit hole into, etc
