# John's GitHub Pages Website

Right now it's just a static resume page generated by Clojure but I'm
hoping to expand in the future.


## Commands

### Generate new files

    clojure -M:generate


## Acknowledgements

Design of the `resume` page commissioned from Kat Garnier aka
[katsinkskyd](https://github.com/katsinskyd)

Structure based off [agzam/resume](https://github.com/agzam/resume)
and changed to suit my personal taste.
