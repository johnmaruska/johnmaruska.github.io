# John's GitHub Pages Website

Right now it's just a static resume page generated by Clojure but I'm
hoping to expand in the future.


## Commands

### Generate new files

    clojure -M:generate


## TODO
- Style links page
- Home page
- Switch to a static site generator when this gets unwieldy
- Look into printing to PDF. Followup, check resume scanners


## Acknowledgements

Design of the `resume` page commissioned from Kat Garnier aka
[katsinkskyd](https://github.com/katsinskyd)

Structure based off [agzam/resume](https://github.com/agzam/resume)
and changed to suit my personal taste.

Links page inspired by [ChaelCodes' blogpost](https://www.chael.codes/2023/10/04/jekyll-links-page.html)
