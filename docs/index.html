      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
        My name is John Maruska. Professionally I'm a software
        engineer, most of my experience has been on backend data
        ingestion systems and my favorite language
        Clojure. Personally, I'm interested in heavy metal, cheesy
        monster movies, VTubers, learning bass guitar, and
        playing co-operative games with friends.

        This website is in the first pass at what I'm hoping will be a
        long-lived personal blogging endeavor. I enjoy reading and learning
        about software development, and I'm hoping this website can act as a
        means to push myself into doing that more actively and get better
        retention out of my efforts.
      </p>

        I don't have any posts yet, so this area mostly serves as a
        placeholder until that happens. Hopefully I'll have something
        to show you soon.
